			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p>
			We love maker products. There's just something about quality, durable, handcrafted household items that beats that cheap stuff you get at a typical store. 

The maker scene has exploded the last couple years, but we still found it difficult to find local maker items. And we talked to countless makers and heard their woes at attempting to market their amazing products. We scratched our heads for a bit and then came up with a solution, MakrBox.com.

In 2013 we created MakrBox to connect quality handmade products with a more expansive audience through a simple monthly delivery of 2-3 household goods.
 
<!-- Our MakrBox team can be found creating and innovating various items that align with our mission of supporting sustainable, repurposed and natural products. -->

			<h3>FAQ</h3>

		<!--	<h5>What if I don't like an item?</h5> 
								 
									<p> We'll gladly return your items, but we encourage you to think outside the box to see if there's a friend of family member who'd love that handmade item. If you still would like a return, please email us at hello@makrbox.com.</p> -->

      	<h5>What kind of items will I get?</h5> 

						<p>Each month our mission it to send you two or three maker items with WOW factor.   We define WOW factor as a mixture of sustainable production, artful craftsmanship and thoughtful design.  Most importantly the goods we send must be useful in your day-to-day lifestyle and make your friends say, “wow, that's incredible, where did you get that!”   Our box is for those who appreciate design and know there is always a better alternative to everything.  <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=KZQ43LS58F39N">Subscribe today!</a></p>


			<h5>What if I don't like an item?</h5>
									<p> Our mothers taught us "you don't always get what you want". So in the case we send you something you don't like put it in the back of your closet.  When mothers day roles around and you have forgotten to get your mother something check the back of you closet...your welcome.   </p>


			<h5>What is a maker and the maker revolution?</h5> 
								
									<p>A maker is any who makes products with their hands, brains, technology, etc. The maker revolution is a part resurgence of real people creating handmade and part democratization of technology. More tools to make products are in the hands of everyday people making the future possibility of maker products endless. What's the best part of the maker revolution? Anyone can be a maker!</p>
