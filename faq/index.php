			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p>
			We love maker products. There's just something about quality, durable, handcrafted household items that beats that cheap stuff you get at a typical store. 

The maker scene has exploded the last couple years, but we still found it difficult to find local maker items. And we talked to countless makers and heard their woes at attempting to market their amazing products. We scratched our heads for a bit and then came up with a solution, MakrBox.com.

In 2013 we created MakrBox to connect quality handmade products with a more expansive audience through a simple monthly delivery of 2-3 household goods.
 
Our MakrBox team can be found creating and innovating various items ourselves that align with our mission of supporting sustainable, repurposed and natural products.

			<h3>FAQ</h3>

			<h5>What if I don't like an item?</h5> 
								 
									<p> We'll gladly return your items, but we encourage you to think outside the box to see if there's a friend of family member who'd love that handmade item. If you still would like a return, please email us at hello@makrbox.com.</p>


			<h5>What if I don't like the item?</h5>
									<p> Our mothers taught us "you don't always get what you want". So in the case we send you something you don't like put it in the back of your closet.  When mothers day roles around and you have forgotten to get your mother something check the back of you closet...your welcome.   </p>

			<h5>What kind of items will I get?</h5> 
							
									<p> Every month you'll receive 2-3 items you'll find useful around your home. Browse our gallery to check out past goods. Most popular items include: a bamboo bath brush that conveniently holds your soap, a natural reusable wax paper alternative to saran wrap, and handmade tea towel with locally inspired designs. </p>



			<h5>Are there any hidden fees?</h5> 
							
									<p> No, never! Your subscription price includes taxes and you'll never see additional charges. </p>

			<h5>What is a maker and the maker revolution?</h5> 
								
									<p>A maker is any who makes products with their hands, brains, technology, etc. The maker revolution is a part resurgence of real people creating handmade and part democratization of technology. More tools to make products are in the hands of everyday people making the future possibility of maker products endless. What's the best part of the maker revolution? Anyone can be a maker!</p>
