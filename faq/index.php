			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p>
			We love maker products. There's just something about quality, durable, handcrafted household items that beats the cheap stuff you get at a typical store. 

The maker and artisan scene has exploded over the last couple of years but we still found it difficult and time consuming to find local maker items. As we talked to many makers we heard challenges in marketing their amazing products. We scratched our heads for a bit and then came up with a solution, MakrBox.com. 

In 2013 we created MakrBox to connect quality handmade products with a more expansive audience by offering a monthly delivery of 2-3 curated household goods. Every item is thoughtfully sourced so all you have to do is open the box, start using the product and start looking cool.
 
<!-- Our MakrBox team can be found creating and innovating various items that align with our mission of supporting sustainable, repurposed and natural products. -->

			<h3>FAQ</h3>

		<!--	<h5>What if I don't like an item?</h5> 
								 
									<p> We'll gladly return your items, but we encourage you to think outside the box to see if there's a friend of family member who'd love that handmade item. If you still would like a return, please email us at hello@makrbox.com.</p> -->

      	<h5>What kind of items will I get?</h5> 

						<p>Each month our mission it to send you two or three products with WOW factor.  We define WOW factor as a mixture of sustainable production, artful craftsmanship and thoughtful design.  Most importantly the goods we send must be useful in your day-to-day lifestyle. The kinds of things that make your friends say, “wow, that's incredible. Where did you get that!?”   Our box is for those who appreciate design and know there is always a better alternative to things we use everyday.  <a href="http://makrbox.com/subscribe/">Subscribe today!</a></p>


			<h5>What if I don't like an item?</h5>
									<p> Our mothers taught us, "you don't always get what you want."  So in the case we send you something that doesn't fit your lifestyle put it in the back of your closet.  When Mother's day roles around and you've forgotten to get your mother something, check the back of your closet...you're welcome. But really, if you don't like one of the items then send us an email and we will get you something you do like- gauranteed  </p>


			<h5>What is a maker and the maker revolution?</h5> 
								
									<p>A maker is anyone who makes products with their hands, brains, technology, etc. The maker revolution is a part resurgence of real people creating handmade products and part democratization of technology. More tools to make products are now in the hands of everyday people, making the future possibility of maker products endless. What's the best part of the maker revolution? Anyone can be a maker!</p>
